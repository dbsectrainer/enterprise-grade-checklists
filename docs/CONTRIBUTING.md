# Contributing to Enterprise Checklist Dashboard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Enterprise Checklist Dashboard as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a note describing your changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use const for all of your references; avoid using var
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Add trailing commas
- Use meaningful variable names

### CSS Style Guide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use kebab-case for class names
- Group related properties together
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Add comments for complex selectors

### HTML Style Guide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include alt attributes for images
- Use meaningful class names
- Keep markup clean and minimal
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

Discussions about the Enterprise Checklist Dashboard take place on this repository's [Issues](../../issues) and [Pull Requests](../../pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.
