# Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains Graphviz DOT files that visualize different aspects of the Enterprise Checklist Dashboard architecture. These diagrams help understand the system's structure, data flow, and component relationships.

## Available Diagrams

1. `architecture.dot` - High-level system architecture
2. `user_flow.dot` - User interaction flow
3. `data_flow.dot` - System data flow
4. `component_relationships.dot` - Component dependencies and interactions

## Generating Diagrams

To generate PNG images from these DOT files, you'll need Graphviz installed on your system.

### Installation

#### macOS

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install graphviz      # RHEL/CentOS
```

#### Windows

Download and install from [Graphviz Downloads](https://graphviz.org/download/)

### Generate Images

Run the following commands from the project root to generate PNG files:

```bash
cd docs/diagrams
dot -Tpng architecture.dot -o architecture.png
dot -Tpng user_flow.dot -o user_flow.png
dot -Tpng data_flow.dot -o data_flow.png
dot -Tpng component_relationships.dot -o component_relationships.png
```

## Diagram Details

### System Architecture (`architecture.dot`)

Shows the high-level system components and their relationships:

### User Flow (`user_flow.dot`)

Maps the complete user journey through the application:

- Navigation paths

### Threat Modeling (`threat_model.dot`)
- Visualizes attack surfaces, trust boundaries, and mitigations for key system components.
- Use this diagram to identify and address potential threats early in the design process.

### Security Architecture (`security_architecture.dot`)
- Shows security controls, network zones, and data protection mechanisms.
- Helps communicate the overall security posture and defense-in-depth strategy.
### Data Flow (`data_flow.dot`)

Illustrates how data moves through the system:

- Data persistence
- State management
- Event system
- User interface updates

### Component Relationships (`component_relationships.dot`)

Details the relationships and dependencies between system components:

- Layer organization
- Component dependencies
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Service interactions

## Updating Diagrams

When making changes to the system architecture:

1. Update the relevant DOT file(s)
2. Regenerate the PNG files
3. Commit both DOT and PNG files
4. Update documentation if the changes affect the system's structure

## Best Practices

- Keep diagrams focused and clear
- Use consistent naming across diagrams
- Include helpful labels and descriptions
- Maintain proper layering and grouping
- Use colors consistently for visual clarity

## Integration with Documentation

These diagrams are referenced in:

- `docs/CASE_STUDY.md` - For technical architecture explanation
- Project README - For high-level system overview
- Development documentation - For implementation details
