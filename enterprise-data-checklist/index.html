                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Are governance policies aligned with regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA,
                        SOX, HIPAA) applicable to your industry?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Have you established clear escalation procedures for data governance
                        violations and exceptions?

                      <li>
                        Start with a lightweight framework and mature it based on organizational
