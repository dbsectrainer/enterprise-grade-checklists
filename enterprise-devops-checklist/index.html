                      <li>
                        Have you defined a clear branching strategy (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, or
                        trunk-based) with documented workflows?

                    <strong>Implementation Questions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Are common recovery scenarios automated with minimal human intervention?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Do automated recovery procedures include safety checks and rollback
                        mechanisms?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Are recovery automation tools integrated with monitoring and alerting
                        systems?
                      </li>
                      <li>Do you have self-healing capabilities for known failure patterns?</li>
                      <li>
                        Are automated recovery procedures tested regularly and updated with new
                        scenarios?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Do manual override capabilities exist for complex or unexpected situations?
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Key Considerations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Automate recovery for well-understood, repeatable failure scenarios first
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Implement progressive automation with human approval gates for high-risk
                        operations
                      </li>
                      <li>Use infrastructure as code to enable rapid environment recreation</li>
                      <li>Monitor automated recovery success rates and continuously improve</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Automated recovery procedures causing more damage than original failure
                      </li>
                      <li>No human oversight or approval for critical recovery operations</li>
                      <li>
                        Recovery automation that hasn't been tested in realistic failure scenarios
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Over-reliance on automation without maintaining manual recovery capabilities
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </label>
