# Enterprise Checklist Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard that combines and tracks progress across eight enterprise-grade checklists covering various domains of software development and operations.

## Overview

The Enterprise Checklist Dashboard provides a unified interface to manage and monitor progress across multiple specialized checklists:

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Data Management
- DevOps Practices
- Mobile Development
- Security Measures
- AI/ML Integration

## Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: Central view of all checklists with progress tracking
- **Global Progress**: Overall completion status across all checklists
- **Search Functionality**: Quick access to specific checklists and topics
- **Progress Persistence**: Automatic saving of progress using localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works on all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant progress updates across all views
- **Reset Capability**: Option to reset progress for fresh starts
- **Independent State**: Separate state management for each checklist
- **Navigation System**: Seamless movement between dashboard and checklists

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Navigate through different checklists using the dashboard cards
4. Track your progress as you complete items in each checklist
5. Use the Return to Dashboard button to navigate back to the main view
