# Enterprise Checklist Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard that combines and tracks progress across eight enterprise-grade checklists covering various domains of software development and operations.

**Live Demo**: [https://dbsectrainer.github.io/enterprise-grade-checklists/](https://dbsectrainer.github.io/enterprise-grade-checklists/)

## Overview

The Enterprise Checklist Dashboard provides a unified interface to manage and monitor progress across multiple specialized checklists:

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Data Management
- DevOps Practices
- Mobile Development
- Security Measures
- AI/ML Integration

## Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: Central view of all checklists with progress tracking
- **Automated Validation**: Built-in validators for each checklist domain
- **Compliance Mapping**: Integrated compliance tracking for standards (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and optimization guides
- **Technical Demonstrations**: Practical examples and implementation guides
- **Documentation & Guides**: Comprehensive guides and best practices
- **Progress Persistence**: Automatic saving of progress using localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works on all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant progress updates across all views
- **Reset Capability**: Option to reset progress for fresh starts
- **Independent State**: Separate state management for each checklist
- **Navigation System**: Seamless movement between dashboard and checklists

## Getting Started

You can either:

- Visit the [live demo](https://dbsectrainer.github.io/enterprise-grade-checklists/) to start using the dashboard immediately, or
- Set up locally:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
  3. Navigate through different checklists using the dashboard cards
  4. Track your progress as you complete items in each checklist
  5. Use the Return to Dashboard button to navigate back to the main view

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

#### Recommended Automated Security Tools

- **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like Snyk, Dependabot, or npm audit to detect vulnerable dependencies in all codebases.
- **Secrets Detection:** Integrate tools such as GitGuardian or truffleHog to scan for secrets in code and configuration files.
- **Static Analysis (SAST):** Use ESLint security plugins, Bandit (Python), or SonarQube for static code analysis.
- **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):** Employ OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for runtime vulnerability scanning.
- **Container Security:** Use tools like Docker Bench Security or Aqua Trivy to scan container images.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automate all security scans in CI/CD pipelines for early detection and remediation.
