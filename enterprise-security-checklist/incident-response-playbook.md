    A[Incident Detection] --> B{Severity Assessment}
    B -->|High| C[Emergency Response]
    B -->|Medium| D[Standard Response]
    B -->|Low| E[Routine Response]
    
    C --> F[Crisis Team Assembly]
    D --> G[IR Team Assembly]
    E --> H[Service Desk]
    
    F --> I[Containment]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    
    I --> J[Investigation]
    J --> K[Remediation]
    K --> L[Recovery]
    L --> M[Post-Incident Review]
```

## 1. Incident Detection & Triage

### Detection Sources
- SIEM Alerts
- EDR/XDR Alerts
- User Reports
- Automated Monitoring
- Third-party Notifications

### Initial Assessment Matrix

| Severity | Impact | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Critical | Business-stopping | Immediate | Executive Team |
| High | Major function impact | < 1 hour | IR Team Lead |
| Medium | Limited impact | < 4 hours | IR Team |
| Low | Minimal impact | < 24 hours | Service Desk |

## 2. Incident Response Procedures

```

### 2.2 Containment Procedures

#### Immediate Actions
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Block malicious IPs/domains
3. Disable compromised accounts
4. Preserve evidence
5. Document all actions

#### Network Containment

    C -->|Monitoring| F[Enhanced Logging]
```

## 3. Investigation Process

### 3.1 Evidence Collection

#### Digital Forensics Checklist

    E --> F[Root Cause]
```

## 4. Remediation Steps

### 4.1 System Recovery
1. Patch vulnerabilities
2. Update security controls
3. Restore from clean backups
4. Verify system integrity
5. Implement additional monitoring

### 4.2 Access Control Review
